## Introduction

It is a database schema using SQLAlchemy for managing sports data. It organizes relationships between sports, tournament types, tournaments, and stats. Below is a breakdown of the classes and relationships


## Database type

- **Database system:** Generic
It is not designed for a specific application or domain. Instead, it provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various data storage and retrieval needs.

# How can you access this project

This project is a simple sports data platform that uses **FastAPI** for the backend and **MySQL** for the database. The setup uses **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You will also need:
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to clone the repository.

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RU-PACE/sports-data-platform.git
cd sports-data-platform
```

## Project Structure

Here‚Äôs an overview of the project structure:

```
sports-data-platform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile               # Dockerfile for FastAPI
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wait-for-db.sh           # Script to wait for MySQL to be ready
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                  # FastAPI application entry point
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml       # Docker Compose configuration file
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                      # Other application files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # This readme file
```

## Setting Up the Application

### Step 1: Pull Docker Images

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines two services:

- **MySQL**: Uses the official `mysql:9.1.0` image.
- **FastAPI**: Uses a custom image (`rupeshkr/myrepo:latest`) which you have built and pushed to Docker Hub.

You don‚Äôt need to build these images yourself as they will be pulled automatically.

### Step 2: Run Docker Compose

Since the `docker-compose.yml` file is inside the `app/` directory, you will need to navigate to the `app/` folder before running Docker Compose.

```bash
cd app
docker-compose up
```

This will:

- Pull the required images (`mysql:9.1.0` and `rupeshkr/myrepo:latest`).
- Set up the MySQL and FastAPI containers.
- Start the services.

### Step 3: Verify Application

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the FastAPI application at:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## How It Works

### 1. **MySQL Service**
The MySQL container is created using the official `mysql:9.1.0` image. It initializes with the following environment variables:

- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Set to `password` (this is the root password for the MySQL database).
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Set to `test` (this is the name of the database created at startup).

The MySQL service will be accessible from the FastAPI application via the following database URL:

```
mysql+pymysql://root:password@mysql:3306/test
```

Here, the `mysql` part refers to the service name defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Docker Compose automatically resolves this to the correct container address.

### 2. **FastAPI Service**
The FastAPI service uses the Docker image `rupeshkr/myrepo:latest`, which contains your FastAPI application. The service waits for the MySQL database to be ready before starting using the `wait-for-db.sh` script.

- The FastAPI app will listen on port `8000` by default.
- The app connects to MySQL using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### 3. **Volumes**
- The MySQL data is persisted in the Docker volume `mysql_data`, ensuring data is not lost when the container is stopped or restarted.
- The FastAPI code is mounted as a volume to allow live code changes without rebuilding the container.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application and remove the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Rebuilding the Images

If you need to rebuild the FastAPI image (for example, after making changes to the code), run the following:

```bash
docker-compose build fastapi
docker-compose up
```

This will rebuild only the FastAPI container and restart the services.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. **MySQL Connection Issues**
If the FastAPI application cannot connect to MySQL, ensure that:
- MySQL is running (`docker ps` to check active containers).
- The MySQL service is ready before FastAPI starts. This is handled by the `wait-for-db.sh` script, which waits for MySQL to be up and running before starting FastAPI.

### 2. **Port Conflicts**
Ensure that port `8000` (for FastAPI) and port `3306` (for MySQL) are not already in use on your machine. If they are, you can change the ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `ports` section.

Example:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:8000"   # FastAPI service running on port 8080
  - "3307:3306"   # MySQL service running on port 3307
```

### 3. **Docker Hub Authentication Issues**
If you face issues with Docker Hub authentication, make sure you're logged into Docker Hub by running:

```bash
docker login
```

Here is a rule set for handling pull requests and a corresponding `README.md` file to guide contributors on how to create and review pull requests effectively.

---

## Pull Request Rule Set

#### 1. **General Guidelines**
- Each pull request (PR) should be tied to an issue or a specific task.
- Ensure that the PR title clearly describes the change.
- Include a detailed description of the changes in the PR body.
- Break large changes into smaller, logical PRs.

#### 2. **Branch Naming**
- Use descriptive branch names to indicate the purpose of the changes.
  Examples:
  - `feature/add-login-api`
  - `bugfix/fix-db-connection`
  - `chore/update-docs`

#### 3. **Commit Messages**
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
  Examples:
  - ‚úÖ **Add user authentication API**
  - ‚úÖ **Fix timeout issue in DB connection**
  - ‚ùå **Fix stuff**
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add" instead of "Added" or "Adds").

#### 4. **Code Review Process**
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved first.
- Ensure code is properly linted and follows good coding standards.
- Include relevant tests (unit, integration, or end-to-end) for new or updated functionality , currently it does not have tests .
- Verify that all checks (CI/CD pipeline) pass before merging.

#### 5. **Testing Requirements**
- Run all tests locally and ensure they pass before creating a PR.
- Add new tests for any newly implemented features or bug fixes.
- Ensure high test coverage (if applicable).

#### 6. **Conflict Resolution**
- Keep the branch up-to-date with the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.
- Resolve conflicts locally and test thoroughly before updating the PR.

#### 7. **Documentation**
- Update the documentation (e.g., `README.md`, API docs) to reflect any new features or changes.
- Ensure any changes affecting external usage are documented clearly.

#### 8. **Labels and Tags**
- Add appropriate labels to the PR, such as:
  - `enhancement`
  - `bug`
  - `documentation`
  - `urgent`
- Use tags like `WIP` (Work in Progress) if the PR is not ready for review.

#### 9. **Merging**
- Use **Squash and Merge** for a clean commit history.
- Avoid merging your own PR unless explicitly allowed.

#### 10. **Closing Issues**
- Use keywords like `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123` in the PR description to automatically close the associated issue upon merging.
